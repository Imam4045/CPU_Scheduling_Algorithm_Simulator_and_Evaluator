# CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator and Evaluator

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a **C++ console-based simulator** that implements and compares four classical CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
- **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

It allows the user to:
- Input process details such as **Burst Time**, **Priority**, and **Time Quantum** (for Round Robin).
- Simulate each scheduling algorithm separately.
- Evaluate all algorithms to find which one yields the **lowest average waiting time**.
- Visualize scheduling through a **Gantt Chart**.

## 🏗️ Project Structure & Explanation

### 1. Process Structure (Data Representation)

Defined using a `struct`:
- `pid`: Process ID
- `burstTime`: CPU burst time
- `waitingTime`: Time spent waiting in the ready queue
- `turn_around_time`: Total time from arrival to completion
- `priority`: Process priority (lower value = higher priority)
- `remaining`: Used in Round Robin to track remaining burst time
- `starting_time`: Not used
- `completion_time`: Not used


### 2. Main Functionalities

- **InputProcesses()**:  
  Collects process data from the user and validates the input.

- **CalculateAverageWT()**:  
  Calculates the average waiting time of processes.

- **DisplayResults()**:  
  Shows a table summary with PID, Burst Time, Waiting Time, and Average Waiting Time.

- **DisplayGanttChart()**:  
  Displays a simple Gantt Chart indicating process execution order and timing.

- **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**:  
  - `fcfs()`: First-Come-First-Serve  
  - `sjf()`: Shortest Job First  
  - `roundRobin()`: Round Robin  
  - `priorityScheduling()`: Priority Scheduling  

- **EvaluateSchedulingAlgorithms()**:  
  Runs all four algorithms, calculates their average waiting times, and displays which performs best.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

1. Copy the code into a `.cpp` file using **VS Code** or any C++ IDE.

2. **Compile the program using:**
   ```bash
   g++ Cpu_Scheduling_Project.cpp -o scheduler
  - If you are running it in VS Code, you can simply use the 'Run Code' option.

3. **Run the executable** using:
   ```bash
   ./scheduler

4. **From the Main Menu, select:**

   * **Algorithm Simulator**
   * **Algorithm Evaluator**
   * **Exit**

### 🔸 **If you choose Option 1 (Algorithm Simulator):**

* Pick an algorithm to simulate (FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority).
* Enter:

  * Number of processes.
  * **Burst Time** for each process.
  * **Priority** (only if Priority Scheduling).
  * **Time Quantum** (only if Round Robin).

### 🔸 **If you choose Option 2 (Algorithm Evaluator):**

* Enter:

  * Number of processes.
  * **Burst Time**, **Priority**, and **Time Quantum**.
* Program will:

  * Run all algorithms.
  * Show Gantt Charts and results.
  * Compare average waiting times and suggest the best algorithm.

## 🎯 **Project Assumptions**

* All inputs (Burst Time, Priority, Time Quantum) are **positive integers**.
* **Non-preemptive** versions of SJF and Priority Scheduling are used.
* **Stable sorting**: If two processes have the same burst time or priority, their order remains as per user input.

---

## ⚠️ **Limitations**

* Not designed for **very large datasets** (e.g., thousands of processes).
* **Basic Gantt Chart**: Does not visualize state changes or preemption details.
